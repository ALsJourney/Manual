This will open the media manager with the directory /images/stories/ already selected an provide an text field like the media field. In addition it offers a text field for add an alternative text. Note that if you are using this field on the frontend then permissions restrictions are likely to be in force. If the user is not authorized to view or add media they will see an error page in the modal popup ("403 You are not authorized to view this resource.").
