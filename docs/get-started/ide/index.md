IDE
===
To develop a Joomla extension we recommend to use an Integrate Development Environment (IDE). An IDE has many benefits:
- Code completion
  - Getting suggestions for code to save reseaching code and avoid errors
  - Auto-implement namespace usage
  - Type hinting when using well documented classes, methods and functions
  - Auto comments for classes/methods/functions
- Code analyser
  - Automate code style feedback
  - Hints for "smelling code" to improve the code quality
- Project/Folder management for extension projects
- many addons/support for daily coding

The two current leading IDEs are [Visual Studio Code](get-started/ide/visual-studio-code.md) and [phpStorm](get-started/ide/phpstorm.md)
