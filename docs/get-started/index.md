## Welcome to the Joomla Developers Manual
The purpose of this guide is to give developers an upto date guide showing best practice in
writing and maintaining Joomla code.
The guide is written using Docusaurus, a system that can allow all users of Joomla to 
contribute
to the documentation. 
We will run through the tools and process required to set you up with the ability to add
to this guide and also get the most out of the guide as a developer.
